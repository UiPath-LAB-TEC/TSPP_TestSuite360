I've uploaded two files that I've created and used in UiBank demos through 2019.

MainFrame.bat: Launches Powershell
PowershellExample.ps1: The actual Powershell script. 

Caveat: It doesn't have any of the real functionality we want with our current UiBank development plan 
- but hopefully it will be useful to anyone who can pick this up.

Ideally we'll need it to have links through to the API, and present data dynamically. Currently, it's a "smoke-and-mirrors" system - but has 
been really useful in demos.
